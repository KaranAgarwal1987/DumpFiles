It sounds like you are exploring three different approaches for integrating and managing data within an ELK Stack for your MVP. Let's clarify and organize each approach to better understand the proposed solutions and their implications:

Approach 1: Enhance Existing Automation Frameworks
Objective: Extend current automation tools (e.g., Autox-Java/NabX-QE) with capabilities to send execution logs directly to ELK.
Tasks:
Develop technical wrappers in Node.js and Java to enable data transmission.
Engage relevant development teams to integrate these wrappers into their current test automation frameworks.
Pros:
Provides more controlled and comprehensive reporting.
Minimizes long-term maintenance.
Cons:
Requires significant initial development effort.
Dependence on multiple teams to implement changes.
Approach 2: Utilize Existing SIT Dashboard Integration
Objective: Integrate project regression execution data into the current ELK implementation under a different namespace.
Tasks:
Utilize the existing SIT (System Integration Testing) dashboard.
Request teams already engaged with the SIT solution to include their regression pipelines.
Pros:
Leverages existing infrastructure, reducing the need for new developments.
Eases the integration process by using familiar tools and processes.
Cons:
Limited control over the execution and data handling.
Potential scalability and process issues that need to be addressed post-MVP.
Approach 3: Create Wrappers for External Test Execution Platforms
Objective: Gather and dump data from external test execution platforms like Perfecto into ELK.
Tasks:
Develop wrappers for platforms such as Perfecto to automate data collection and dumping.
Implement these wrappers to streamline data flow into ELK.
Pros:
Allows for better control and understanding of test executions.
Can be expanded post-MVP to include more data sources and refine data integration.
Cons:
Complexity in creating separate wrappers for each external platform.
Initial challenges in managing data integrations and understanding technical limitations.
Summary of Approaches
Approach 1 focuses on enhancing internal capabilities to improve data control and reporting with a significant upfront effort.
Approach 2 aims to utilize existing solutions for quick integration, though it may face scalability limits.
Approach 3 prepares for broader integration possibilities by establishing data conduits with external platforms, providing long-term benefits at the cost of initial complexity.
Each approach has its merits and challenges, and the choice among them will depend on your current infrastructure capabilities, resource availability, and long-term data strategy goals. It would be beneficial to evaluate these approaches based on expected implementation timeframes, dependency on external teams, and alignment with your organization's strategic objectives.
