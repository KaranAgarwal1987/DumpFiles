To ensure the NAB QE Tech Radar remains a relevant and authoritative guide, the Automation Governance Authority is responsible for its regular maintenance. This central body, composed of skilled Test Engineers, conducts structured reviews semi-annually to reflect upon and recalibrate our technology strategies. These sessions incorporate the latest developments, team feedback on technology performance, and any notable trends within the tech industry. We actively seek and integrate insights from teams across NAB, promoting a collaborative atmosphere where every contribution shapes the radar's evolution. Vigilance towards technological advancements guarantees that our radar is aligned with the most significant and influential tools and practices. The update process is transparent and participatory, ensuring all changes are well-understood and contribute to a culture of continuous development and tech excellence at NAB.
