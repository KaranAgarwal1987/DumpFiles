The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) aims to evaluate and develop a centralized reporting system using automation project data. This system will help in understanding technical and procedural aspects of a proposed full-scale system, allowing early testing of assumptions and identification of potential challenges with minimal resource commitment.

Key Tasks and Goals
Project Selection for Central Reporting
Goal: Identify a few automation projects whose data can be used for centralized reporting.
Approach: Select projects that vary in scope and complexity to provide diverse data for analysis.
Evaluation of Kibana (K Stack)
Goal: Evaluate the effectiveness of Kibana in generating the necessary reporting graphs and charts that meet pre-agreed business requirements.
Approach: Test Kibana with sample data from the selected projects to assess its capability in visualizing data as per business needs.
Defining Reporting Hierarchy
Goal: Establish a clear reporting hierarchy from the business unit to the application level that can be consistently interpreted by the leadership team.
Approach: Collaborate with business analysts and leaders to map out and agree upon a hierarchical structure that reflects organizational and reporting needs.
Tool Evaluation for Test Management
Goal: Evaluate different tools used for test management and execution to understand the possibilities for data ingestion.
Approach: Analyze current tools in use, assess their data export capabilities, and determine how they can integrate with the Kibana dashboard.
Gap Analysis in Test Processes
Goal: Identify gaps in the current test processes and the usage of test management tools.
Approach: Document current workflows, pinpoint inefficiencies or lacks, and strategize on potential improvements or technology enhancements.
Documentation and Strategy Development
Goal: Develop a strategic plan to address identified gaps and document how the MVP can facilitate these improvements.
Approach: Create comprehensive documentation that outlines the problems, proposed solutions, and the step-by-step strategy to implement changes.
Expected Outcomes
Insights into Data Visualization: Understand how data can be effectively visualized and interpreted using Kibana, facilitating better decision-making.
Enhanced Reporting Framework: Develop a scalable and efficient reporting framework that can be adopted across various levels of the organization.
Improved Test Management: Enhance the effectiveness of test processes and tools through better integration and data usage.
Conclusion
The MVP will serve as a foundation to gauge the feasibility and effectiveness of a centralized reporting system before committing to a full-scale implementation. By addressing these tasks, the project aims to deliver valuable insights and improvements in both technical and procedural dimensions.

This organized approach should help you present your MVP plan clearly and effectively. If you need to dive deeper into any specific section or need further assistance with the presentation format, feel free to ask!
