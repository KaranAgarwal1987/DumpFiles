Definition: Technologies in the Adopt quadrant are recommended for widespread use within the organization. They have been tested and proven to be valuable and are considered stable and secure for full-scale implementation.
Example: A new version of a robust programming framework that has been successfully piloted and shown to improve productivity might be placed in this quadrant.
Assess
Definition: Technologies placed in the Assess quadrant are promising but require further analysis and proofs-of-concept to evaluate their potential value to the organization.
Example: An emerging data storage technology that could offer performance benefits but hasn't been thoroughly tested in the organization's specific environment.
Continue
Definition: The Continue quadrant is for technologies that are currently in use and are delivering ongoing value. These technologies are not new to the scene but should continue to be supported and invested in.
Example: A well-established cloud platform service that the organization depends on for its daily operations and which consistently delivers value.
Retire
Definition: Technologies in the Retire quadrant are considered outdated, less efficient, or risky, and should be phased out in favor of more current solutions.
Example: An older version of a software library that no longer receives security updates and could pose a risk to the system if not updated or replaced
